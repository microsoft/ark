# Code Structure Overview  
  
This codebase is organized into several top-level files and directories, each serving a specific purpose. Here's a brief overview of the structure:  
  
## Top-level Files  
  
- `cpu_timer.cc` and `cpu_timer.h`: Implementation and header files for CPU timing functionality.  
- `dims.cc` and `dims_test.cc`: Implementation and tests for the dimensions functionality.  
- `env.cc` and `env.h`: Environment-related implementation and header files.  
- `executor.cc`: Execution-related functionality.  
- `file_io.cc` and `file_io.h`: File input/output implementation and header files.  
- `init.cc`: Initialization-related functionality.  
- `kahypar.h` and `kahypar_test.cc`: Header and test files for the Kahypar library.  
- `logging.cc` and `logging.h`: Logging implementation and header files.  
- `math.cc` and `math.h`: Mathematical functions implementation and header files.  
- `model.cc`, `model_io.cc`, and `model_io.h`: Model-related implementation and header files.  
- `model_test.cc`: Model-related test file.  
- `random.cc`: Random number generation functionality.  
- `tensor.cc`: Tensor-related functionality.  
- `threading.h`: Threading-related header file.  
- `utils.cc`: General utility functions.  
  
## Directories  
  
### gpu  
  
This directory contains GPU-related files, including GPU buffer management, GPU memory management, GPU kernel implementation and tests, and GPU manager functionality.  
  
### include  
  
This directory contains header files for the entire project. It includes general headers (e.g., `ark.h`, `ark_utils.h`) and a subdirectory named `kernels` that contains kernel-specific headers.  
  
### ipc  
  
The ipc directory contains files related to inter-process communication, including the implementation of shared memory, socket communication, and IPC-related test files.  
  
### net  
  
This directory contains files for the InfiniBand network implementation and tests.  
  
### ops  
  
This directory contains files for implementing and testing various operations, such as addition, multiplication, and convolution. It also includes a subdirectory named `kernels` that contains simple kernel implementations.  
  
### sched  
  
This directory contains files related to scheduling, including different scheduling algorithms, code generation, operation graph representation, and profiling functionality.  
  
### unittest  
  
This directory contains utility files for unit testing.  
  
By understanding this code structure, users can easily navigate the codebase and find the relevant files for their needs.
